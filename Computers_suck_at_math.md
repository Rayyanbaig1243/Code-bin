# You think u suck at math don't worry you are not alone, no its not me I meant computers they really suck at math wondering why?  

## lets see :

### Python Shell:

```py
>>> 1 + 1
2
>>> #seems alright doesn't it now check this :
>>> 0.1 + 0.2
0.30000000000000004
```
Now don't think this is a python problem well lets see `Javascript` (Node js command prompt)

```js
> 0.1+0.2
0.30000000000000004
```

###### Belive me now ?
